## About
This is my *veeery quuuick* W10M port of [Nixxs's GeoWar](https://github.com/Nixxs/GeoWar) project. :)

Main goal: do some testing/exploration of new "native" (not mine) MonoGame.Framework.WindowsUniversal v3.7.1.189 package

## Status of my GeoWar porting
- Main W10M device : Lumia 950; sdk 15063+ (Last) - all ok and touchscreen reacted .. but no screen rescaling :( 
- Secondary W10M device : sdk 10240 (Astoria) - touchscreen fixed (my own tweaked MonoGame UWP Framework used)
- Game sounds&music - fixed (some support of cool fx effects discovered)
- Game speed -- fixed too :)
- Original kbd control still present for desktop mode 
- Fullscreen mode distorted on Astoria ("header"/"footer" not hide -- game score truncated :)
- "Screen autoscaling" added (to/for supporting different devices / screen sizes)
- Content (resources) optimized (reduced from 53 mb to 22mb)
